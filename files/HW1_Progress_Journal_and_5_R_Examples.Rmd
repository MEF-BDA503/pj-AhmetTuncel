###2) [Personalised Medicine - EDA with tidy R](https://www.kaggle.com/headsortails/personalised-medicine-eda-with-tidy-r)

This is an early Exploratory Data Analysis for the Personalized Medicine: Redefining Cancer Treatment challenge. I will be using ggplot2 and the tidyverse tools to study and visualise the structures in the data.
